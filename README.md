# Self-study of "A Tour of C++"

This repo contains some development that follows the chapters of "tour of C++".

It is not supposed to contain the _exact_ code snippets found in those chapters.
Rather, it contains code snippets that helped me in understanding the concepts
therein by trying things myself.
